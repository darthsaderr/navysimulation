# navysimulation
This project was for my Object Oriented Design class.

Over the course of the semester we did a simulation of the software life cycle, starting with requirements and ending with a show-and-tell instead of a final exam.
Each student wrote their own simulation, many of which didn't completely work on the day of the final but mine did work and has since been untouched.
